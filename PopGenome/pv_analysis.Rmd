Not sure yet what I'm doing here... 

```{r, engine='bash'}



```


First, need to load library:
```{r}
library(PopGenome)
```

Next, read in the data:
```{r}
data <- readData("data", format="VCF")
    # Only need to point to the folder that contains the files
    # , gffpath="data"

data <- readVCF("data", frompos=1, topos=10000000)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
